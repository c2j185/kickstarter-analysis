**# Kickstarting with Excel**

**## Overview of Project**

**### Purpose**

The purpose of the analysis was to visualize and compare how successful different plays were at meeting their fundraising goal. Analyzing whether the amount of the goal or the relative launch date of the Kickstarter campaign had any bearing on how successful a campaign was.

**## Analysis and Challenges**

**### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date**

According to the data, there were more successful Kickstarter campaigns launched in May than in any other month. May is also the month with the most number of campaigns launched. 

**### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals**

According to the data, plays with goals less than $5,000 had a success rate of 72.7%-75.8%. It would be more beneficial to pay attention to outcomes instead of launch dates for a Kickstarter campaign.

**### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

One of the biggest challenges that I encountered was getting the formulas just right. I struggled in making sure that everything was typed in the formula bar correctly. 

**## Results**

In May, 67% of the total number of campaigns were successful. The percentage range for the other months vary between 57% to 65% of the total number of campaigns as successful. While there are 10 percentage points between highest percent successful and lowest percent successful; the data doesn’t appear to support that launch date had much significance in how successful a campaign was going to be.
Looking at the data of the outcomes based on goals, it was very clear that campaigns under $5,000 were more successful. 
One limitation for the data set is an absence of previous years’ data. We do not know if the data trended in a similar way each year. Another limitation is we don’t know how well each campaign was advertised. If a campaign was better advertised and shared, it could also have an impact on how successful a campaign was.
Another possible table and/or graph that could have been used would be actually looking and comparing percentages of successful and failed campaigns instead of just the amount of campaigns.
